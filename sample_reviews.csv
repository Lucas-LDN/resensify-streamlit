Both were friendly and professional and knew exactly what they were doing. We will refer them to family and friends and will without a doubt be saving their number and calling them back for future projects! If only all handymen/women could be this great! 

Five stars are simply not enough!

Thanks Tony & Kelly!",5,"Home Decor, Home & Garden, Shopping, Local Services, Handyman, Home Theatre Installation, TV Mounting, Home Services",AZ,11/03/2019 18:37,0,Half Price TV Wall Mounting Service

Richard was not pleasant and would not break a quarter when the total was $17.06. Extremely rude. Said he didn't want to risk his drawer being off.

6019183,"This was a nice side stop on our visit to Phoenix. Since this is only shopping place we checked out in Phoenix, so can only compare to what we have in Houston. This is worth shopping for regular stores (ie gap, banana republic, tommy Bahamas, etc) for good sale prices. Would definitely come back. If you're looking for high end stores like LV, you won't find here.

6447828,"I've been wanting to go to this ""museum"" for years.  The unusual hours and the high cost kept me away on several Vegas visit.  I finally went and visited for a morning tour.  It's $18 ($12 student) for an hour tour.  

Seeing all of these signs up close is really neat, and it's a great spot to get some really cool photos.  Still, the hour tour provided a lot of info that I didn't really care about, and the place would be much better suited if the was an audio guide and/or some signage describing the pieces.  

I'm glad we did the day tour. It can get quite hot for the last tour (10am in summer), but the night tour at the time only had 4 signs lit up and cost $7 more.  

Free parking on site.

Bottom Line: Cool, but overpriced.  Good tour, but this space could be much better and cheaply operated.",3,"Local Flavor, Arts & Entertainment, Tours, Hotels & Travel, Art Museums, Museums, Shopping, Art Galleries",NV,23/09/2014 15:35,5,Neon Museum

A Shack soldering iron no less, but they didn't carry but a few types and with my luck, not the one I needed. I still like the fact they carry all kinds of small electrical parts however, this location isn't very large but you can still find that elusive 330K resistor in a pinch.

If you are contemplating whether or not to shop here. Look no further, here is one stop shop. He can order almost everything!

I regret my hast and truly look forward to attending class, shooting on their range and receiving my permit. Thanks for getting me in your upcoming class and your professionalism Eric.

5814708,"I've had mixed experiences here. My fiance and I were both looking for professional attire and wanting some nicer, tailored wardrobe staples. I've heard you can expect a great experience from Nordstrom, so we drove up from Tucson. We didn't have that in the men's department. My fiance worked with a salesperson who wasn't very helpful, just pulled a couple of basic slacks. We thought he'd get better advice or feedback from the tailor, but both he and the salesman were overly casual like ""Do you want these or not?"" We weren't happy with the experience. We actually left and went to Saks and had a much better experience with a salesperson there.

We came again for me. First walking the women's floor, I saw a vast amount of casual and trendy pieces, things I would not wear to the office. I asked one salesperson and a tailor on the floor who pointed me to the Point of View section where I still couldn't find much. But the tailor did set me up with Kyiana, who was very helpful (despite being super busy) and provided the personalized shopping experience I'd expect from a Nordstrom store. She started me with several items and pulled additional sizes for me. She checked on me frequently but wasn't overbearing or pushy. I felt comfortable telling her if I didn't care for something she picked. She brought me a couple blazers to try, which I wasn't looking for, but ended up really liking and purchasing one. The tailor is shortening the arms and it's being shipped to me (hopefully in time for an upcoming interview). I left happy and would return and ask for her again.

Overall, I'd like to see more classic looks in the store. Of course, a department store wants to feature certain designers and be on trend. But not everyone wants super on-trend pieces. It was actually very difficult for me to find things appropriate for work (I needed a lot of help), and most of the merchandise was too casual.",3,"Women's Clothing, Department Stores, Men's Clothing, Fashion, Shopping",AZ,02/04/2019 19:27,0,Nordstrom Chandler Fashion Center

The front desk lady is really nice and helpful, they offer me a good place and fix everything within an hour, I am definitely appreciate their work and effort, they give me a glass screen protector for free, love it! 
They don't have sign outside of their office which kinda difficult for me to find it at the first place.

6040322,"Do not use this store for in store pickup. They either have a thief in their store or are completely incompetent. Order is signed for by there receiving person yet mysteriously it is not in the store. Asked them to investigate and they gave the run around. Asked them to cancel the sell and they say there is nothing they can do. With out the computer they can't cancel the sell so now I'm out $2,500.00 and all they can say is oh well. Second time I've used this store for in store pickup and they all must hate their jobs because the last time I went in to pickup my phone they were extremely grumpy.

It's an easy and, admittedly a lazy, way to shop but I love it! I took one star away because I find their women's plus size clothing to be very hit or miss in terms of sizing and fit.

Seriously, their usual selection is great - If you can't find something for you at DSW you don't have feet - but for the frugal shoe-lady in me their clearance department can't be beat.",5,"Shoe Stores, Fashion, Shopping",NV,02/04/2007 22:39,0,DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse

We got a green one with pineapple inside it was delicious. Bought a cute hello kitty lamp for my daughter for $4. Some people over price by overall good prices if you bargain. Didn't get to try the corn in the cup but it looked delicious. Had some birria tacos that were Bombay! Compared to California flea markets this outdoor one is pretty big.

5436965,"Finally persuaded my husband to search for a new mattress, and I knew from previous mattress-shopping experiences that I wanted to hit up a Best Mattress location. Their reps were great then, and I wasn't disappointed at this most recent experience. 
Knowing it was Black Friday weekend, my husband thought it'd be fine to see what sales were going on between major retailers. Best Mattress was no exception, knocking off between $300-$500 off listed prices and including a free gift (e.g., adjustable base up to a certain dollar amount). The cool thing about this location though was the space! There was a huge variety to peruse through. Being an organizational freak, I liked how they grouped their brands/types. 
Since we already knew our comfort levels when it comes to how firm a mattress needs to be, Steve was able to suggest ones that would be a happy compromise for us. Super patient in walking us through the sale's details, then letting us revisit our favorites when my husband decided that this was the spot for us to shop. I'd also like to point out that Steve was extremely knowledgeable when it came to financing options - we all know that quality cost extra. Anyway, he knew the company's history with different banks to the present option (Synchrony), and how the same vendor finances other service retailers (e.g., Walker Furniture). All interesting information, but my husband liked his customer service style the most.
It's all been a promising new experience, so we'll just see how the delivery day goes, and hopefully attest to the positive quality of the mattress and cover we purchased.",4,"Mattresses, Home & Garden, Shopping, Furniture Stores",NV,02/12/2019 00:27,4,Best Mattress
